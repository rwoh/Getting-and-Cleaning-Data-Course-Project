# My Submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coure Project

###Submitted files:
 - README.md - this file
 - run_analysis.R - An R script that processes the dataset of http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
 - CodeBook.md - A code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations that I performed to clean up the data
 
### Usage of run_analysis.R:
  - Download https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  - Set your R working directory to the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder contained in the above zip file and run run_analysis.R
  - This will create a file mytidydataset.txt, which is the output of write.table(). (see CodeBook.md for more details)
